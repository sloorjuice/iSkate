## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This app uses [Expo-Maps]() so you'll need to use a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) on an emulator or device instead of [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go).
